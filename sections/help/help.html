                    Why Do We Need Transaction Fees?
                  </h1>
                  <p>For every transaction that you submit to the blockchain, you need to pay a small amount of fees. This is required in order to prevent a certain type of DDOS (distributed denial of service) where an attacker submits a large number of transactions to the network with the intention to clog the processing of other, more legitimate, transactions. This, of course, also includes transactions that include results a miner has found priorly.</p><p>While this may sound counter-intuitive on the first sight, it makes a greater sense when thinking more about it: even though the verification of work results is implemented very efficiently, it still may become a bottleneck for a large number of result submissions. While attackers indeed can still submit a large number of work results that won't pass the verification checks, they can only do so at the cost of the minimum required fees required to be attached to all transactions. This discourages the average hedonic attacker to conduct this attack.</p><p>This, however, means that you are required to start with a certain amount of XEL in order to work on other people's jobs. As this may post a hurdle to the average technically interested user who just wants to take a quick "sneek peek", you can request our faucet in order to get a few XEL that might help you get started.</p>

                        How is the Network Power Assessed?
                      </h1>
                      <p>Since the XEL blockchain is decentralized with many computation nodes (each having different hardware specs) mostly acting entirely independently of each other, measuring the overall computational power is a bit challenging. What would be very easy in a centralized setting, where you exactly know how many nodes are participating and how many of their resources they are contributing, is requiring for new approaches in the decentralized and anonymous setting that we face here. In fact, since we do not have a "roster" of who is participating, the answer can be only given heuristically, providing a rough (and potentially unprecise) prediction.</p>
                      <p>The approach we have used for the prediction of the computational power in Xeline relies on observing the so-called target value. The network has an internal target value (similar to Bitcoin's block target mechanism) which tries to scale the frequency of proof-of-work packages (solutions to work packages, that the miners occasionally find and get paid for) to around 10 per minute. The faster the network becomes, the more the target value scales down - making the cryptographical puzzles harder in order to tune into the correct proof-of-work frequency. We assume that, on the grand scheme, the target value scales proportionally with the amount of computational power in the network. We have performed a dry run on an iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2017) with a Core i5 3.8GHz CPU and, while mining on all cores, measured where the target value converges to in order to maintain 10 proof-of-work packages per second. This target value is assumed to reflect the machine's processing power of 57.5 MIPS. Using this as a baseline, we can now predict the momentarliy present  computational power in the network by proportionally scaling our ground truth to the current target value. Please note, that this value only reflects a rough estimation.</p>

                        More Information Regarding the Monitoring of the Miner
                      </h1>
                      <p>You cannot start the miner from within the Xeline UI, but Xeline will be aware of it when you start the miner on the same computer and will present you the speed at which the miner is operating in the GUI. The speed itself is given by e/s, thich means "evaluations per second". The tasks on the XEL network are user-programmed: some of them may be hashes, some of them may be mathematical calculations, and others may be something entirely different. Hence, it would be wrong to, as it is practiced amongst other proof-of-work currencies, speak of "hashes per second". Instead, we measure the miner speed in how many times it can evaluate those user programmed tasks per second at the moment. The miner, by the way, only performs work when there are actually tasks available and certain limits are not yet met for the current block; it may happen that the miner goes into a temporary idle mode and waits for the next block. In this case, the speed will drop to 0 e/s.</p>
